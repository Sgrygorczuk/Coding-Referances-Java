		Java uses two systems for GUI (Graphics User Interface), prenouce Goo-ee, one is Swing and the other is AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)
		AWT uses the platfomr that it's being used on for it's graphical look and feel, for instnace if you are using windows it will 
		take the mimize, maximze and close button layout like all windows aplciatons. On the other hand Swing allows you to spceify the 
		look and feel of your GUI. Most compoments of of Swing are lightweight componetns since they will use Java's preset look and feel
		while AWT is seen as heavyweight since it will use the platforms look and feel.
